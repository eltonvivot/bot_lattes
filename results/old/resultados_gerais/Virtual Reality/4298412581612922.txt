Geometric Modeling Guided by Gestures
Descrição: Graphic Computing became a constant, be in movies, cards, video games, television, and others. Most of the content generated for this media is three-dimensional, such as movie characters, done by artists through geometric modeling. Therefore, this study aims to create techniques of geometric modeling using devices to movement capture. These techniques will make the artists work easier, once that they can work with the movement of their hands instead of using non-natural devices, such as the computer mouse..
