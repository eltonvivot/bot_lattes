Development of the Reliability Technology for Package on Package
Descrição: PoP(package on package) technology becomes one of the most popular semiconductor packages for mobile applications. Due to the stacking nature of the PoP, warpage of one package layer can deteriorate the overall PoP structure. In order to ensure the reliability of the PoP, it is critical to minimize the warpage of the PoP by optimizing the process parameters. In this project, the process technology to minimize warpage of the PoP will be investigated through experiments and simulations on the relationship between the warpage and proc This project will be performed collaboratively with Unisinos University in Brazil and will be supported by Hana Micron and Seoul Techno Park in Korea, and also HT Micron and Semiconductor Research Center in Brazil. In this project, the PoP reliability technology means the PoP process technologies which can minimize the PoP warpage in order to prevent formation of the open solder joints during stacking of the top package and the bottom package of the PoP. The purpose of this project is to establish the PoP reliability by investigating the process technologies suitable for PoP stacking with minimization of the PoP warpage. To accomplish the purpose of the project, the core process technologies for PoP stacking will be developed. Analysis on the relationship between the PoP warpage and process parameters will be also conducted through experiments and simulations, and will be utilized to develop the process technologies to minimize the PoP warpage.ess parameters..
