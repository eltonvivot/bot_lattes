Exploratory Virtual Model (MVE): Proposal of a Sales Tool for the Residential Estate Market.
Descrição: As it is an important topic of scientific research, the project has proposed the MVE development for selling residential real estate property. The MVE was modeled with a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) / BIM (Building Information Modeling) tool which proved adequate to meet the requirements raised in the survey. The MVE was evaluated through case studies in real estate ventures with brokers and customers. Results show that MVE can be developed with much lower cost and in shorter time than the architectural mockup or the mock-up flat and that it has very well accepted both by real estate sales professionals and clients..
