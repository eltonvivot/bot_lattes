A 3D radiomics-based artificial neural network model to vertebral compression fractures classification in MRI exams
Descrição: The differential diagnosis of non-traumatic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) has been
the subject of research for more than 20 years and still presents challenges for radiologists. Quantitative
features extracted from images have the potential to help the diagnosis independently of characteristics
visually perceptible. Our proposal is to investigate if radiomic features and an artificial neural network
can differentiate benign from malignant vertebral compression fractures in MRI.. Situação: Concluído; Natureza: Pesquisa. Integrantes: Natália Santana Chiari Correia - Coordenador / Marcello Henrique Nogueira Barbosa - Integrante / Paulo Mazzoncini de Azevedo Marques - Integrante.
