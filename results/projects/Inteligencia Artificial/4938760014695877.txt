On Knowing What Something Is: Towards an Account of Concept Possession
Descrição: In recent years, knowledge-wh?knowledge who, what, when, where, which, why etc.?has attracted much attention from philosophers and linguists alike, with many arguing that a unified account of these varieties of knowledge can be given (Karttunen, 1977; Groenendijk & Stokhof, 1982; Böer & Lycan, 1986; Schaffer, 2007). Discussions of knowledge-wh have also attracted attention from those interested in the debate surrounding states of knowing how, such as Stanley and Williamson (2001), who have tried to show that the nature of these states can be clarified by unifying attributions of know-how with those of knowledge-wh. In this research, I will try to show that existing accounts of knowledge-wh can also throw light in a different philosophical debate, that concerning concepts. More specifically, I will try to show that the idea of one having a concept can be illuminated by adopting a view according to possess a concept of something is simply a matter of knowing what that something is. This equivalence is theoretically useful as long as we have a have a solid account of the knowledge of what something is in hand. The main aim of this research is to develop such an account and show how it can be useful to deal with several questions regarding concept possession.. Situação: Em andamento; Natureza: Pesquisa.
