PROJETO DE BIOFABRICAÇÃO DE BIOPOLÍMEROS E BIOPROCESSOS CUSTOMIZADOS À IMPLANTES
Descrição: Este projeto de pesquisa propõe desenvolver biopolímeros voltados para a aplicação de implantes médicos desenvolvidos por um reator multipropósito também proposto neste projeto. Os biopolímeros propostos serão produzidos a partir de produtos derivados da biomassa brasileira, como por exemplo, o poliól de açaí. 
Para obtenção de um processo otimizado e redução dos custos de fabricação, este projeto propõe uma metodologia e uma equipe multidisciplinar, onde aplicará a integração de métodos e tecnologias já conhecidas a favor de um novo processo.. Situação: Em andamento; Natureza: Pesquisa. Alunos envolvidos: Graduação: (3)  / Mestrado acadêmico: (1)  / Doutorado: (1) . Integrantes: Ricardo Augusto de Almeida - Coordenador / Samuel Scarassatti Freitas - Integrante / Cecilia Amélia de Carvalho Zavaglia - Integrante / Carmen Gilda Barroso Tavares - Integrante / Daniela Moura Yoshida - Integrante / Laís Pellizzer Gabriel - Integrante.

Determination of decision making in distributed dynamical systems controlled in real-time by Fuzzy logic algorithms.
Descrição: The technological advancement in dynamic process control is a partial reflection of mechanical and electronic equipment precision developed by studies in sciences and engineering areas. Currently the equipments and devices can be controlled by sophisticated computer systems that process data multi-variables at speeds above 1 GHz. This way is possible that Artificial Intelligence algorithms to doing the prediction of the process behavior?s applied in the chemical, manufacturing and military applications.
This multidisciplinary technological leap for the advance of the process control cooperated and made the development of new products that were inviable so far, due to absence of this toolset.
The techniques of acquisition, transfer, control, computing equipment variables and devices in the field, are indispensable in the processes currently developed by any engineering. With such techniques of automation control of dynamic processes was possible embed Distributed Systems such as Intelligent automation of Field equipment (Fieldbus) such as: Foundation Fieldbus, AS-i, Interbus, Modbus, LONWorks, ProfiBus, DeviceNet.
There are process control technologies already known through Function Blocks: Proportional Integral (PI), Proportional derivative (PD), Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), who are traditional techniques of control.
Many studies carried out with Advanced Models of process control by applying computational techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic, Neuro-fuzzy and genetic algorithms.
In this context is totally appropriate to use smart devices that can process data acquired in the field through industrial networks, such as in distributed systems for Automation (Fieldbus), to provide data to the supervisior of the devices and increasing the quality of scientific study produced in universities.
The complexity of current systems, trends in industrial automation and the use of supervisory systems, did to increase the quality of the. Situação: Em andamento; Natureza: Pesquisa.
