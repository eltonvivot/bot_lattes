Descrição: The objective of the project is to provide the necessary and optimized resources to IoTs of two types: massive IoTs and IoT actuators (low latency). As a case of use, we will work on the management of IoT resources applied in the field of energy. In this project, we propose to provide solutions to dynamically manage the slice resources of two types of connected objects: massive connected objects (IoTs) and actuators with a focus on energy uses, using SDN technologies ( Software Defined Networking) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization). SDN separates the control plan and the data plan, and has many advantages for more flexible and scalable network management, making network programming and natural integration to virtualization systems possible. On the other hand, NFV technology converts network processes traditionally associated with specialized proprietary hardware (eg routers, firewalls, etc.) into virtualized software platforms that run on standard generic hardware. These functions can be moved in the network on demand and resized as needed. SDN makes it possible to virtualize and move these network functions by adding flows or duplicating them for virtualized functions placed in the network. The combination of SDN and NFV will allow to instantiate / create virtual networks or slices networks on demand.. Situação: Concluído; Natureza: Pesquisa.
