Pressure induced phase transition in ErH3
Descrição: The behaviour of hydrogen in the metallic environments governs the physical properties of a wide range of fundamental and technological interest. These include pure metallic hydrogen and metal hydrides, which are formed in the chemical reaction between metals and hydrogen. In particular, the yttrium and rare-earth hydrides display a dramatic changing in their optical properties depending on the hydrogen content. These systems can change reversibly from shiny metallic to transparent insulating films upon hydrogenation by varying the hydrogen gas pressure or by electrochemical means. Such behaviour is a consequence of the structure phase transformation accompanied by a metal-insulator tran-sition that occurs with increasing (decreasing)hydrogenconcentration.  
The pressure induced phase transition in ErH3 is investigated by ab initio calculation. The electronic structure is using projected augmented wave (PAW) method and the properties for the phase transition were obtained by fitting the energy-volume set to the Murnaghan equation of states. We have found a structural phase transformation accompanied by an insulator-metal transition at 17Gpa in good agreement with the experimental finding. The similar phase transition is predicted to GdH3 as well.. Situação: Concluído; Natureza: Pesquisa. Alunos envolvidos: Doutorado: (1) .

Nanoprous_Porous Silicon
Descrição: Focusing in the nanoporous  problem the objective of our study is to perform a comparison among different PS canonical structural patterns taking into account a possible surface structure correlation with PL and absorption  performances, a structural quantum phenomenum that we call active nanoporosity. In another hand, the roughness, fractal dimensions and phase disorder measures could be important parameters for a fine investigation of structural differences among samples with very high porosity of both the Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) images. Also we use the  gradient pattern analysis technique as a reliable method to investigate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the morphology of PS active porosity. 
Recently, Ferreira da Silva et al.,have performed a gradient pattern analysis of a canonical sample set (CSS) of scanning force microscopy (SFM) images of PS.  They applied the Gradient Pattern Analysis (GPA) to images of three typical PS samples distinguished by different absorption energy levels and aspect ratios (low, intermediate and high roughness). The GPA is an innovative technique, which characterizes the formation and evolution of extend patterns based on the spatio-temporal correlations between large and small amplitude fluctuations of the structure represented as a gradient field .Energy level diagram developed from PL, PLE, and PAS measurements, and molecular electronic structure calculations as described in detail in the text.  The highest occupied fluorophor molecular orbital is called the HOMO and the energy levels of the fluorophor from experiment are compared to the energetics for the silicon surface to which the fluorophor is bound. Only the zero point energy level and first SiO dominated vibrational mode are indicated although several higher-lying discrete vibrational quanta exist in the fluorophor ground electronic state ..

Thermal lens and photoacoustic spectroscopy to determine the thermal and optical  properties in bulk and thin film semiconductors
Descrição: It is well recognized that the characteristic of the photothermal phenomena to determine the thermal and optical properties of materials via the energy transfer processes that results in heat generation is a particular advantage of these methods as compared to others conventional techniques, especially when the studied materials present high degree of: opacity, scattering and reflectance. The purpose of this work is to combine the particular abilities of the photoacoustic spectroscopy with those of the thermal lens spectrometry to study  different semiconductor samples. Three of them are in the thin film form, 4H-SiC, Ni80Cr20 and NiO, while the PbI2 is a bulk single crystal. 4H-SiC was grown by hot wall chemical vapor deposition , Ni80Cr20 and NiO  were obtained by sputter deposition and the PbI2 single crystal was grown by the Bridgman method with the c-axis oriented perpendicular to the growth axis ..

Si1-xGex alloys
Descrição: Silicon Germanium (Si1-xGex) alloy is good candidate as a substitute material for Si in low-power and high-speed semiconductor device technologies. Optoelectronic devices, such as heterojunction bipolar transistors, are already in industrial production. Si1-xGex  is also promising as alloying material for quantum well devices, infrared detectors, and modulation-doped field-effect transistors. Although much efforts have been paid on the growth of Si1-xGex  and Si1-xGex /Si as well on electrical characterization, there is still a lack of information about the optical properties of Si1-xGex . We are investigating the electronic structure of this alloy as a function of composition x.Extendind the investigation to the dielectric functions. Situação: Em andamento; Natureza: Pesquisa.

Electronic and optical properties of rutile titanium oxide (TiO2)
Descrição: The compound rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been recongnized as very promising material with large technological applicabilities, as for instance coating and gas sensores.
Since the photocatalytic splitting of water by titanium dioxide (TiO2) was first reported by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 , extensive investigation has been devoted to the study of this wide band-gap semiconductor. Titanium dioxide has been proven to be outstanding in several fields, including applications such as gas sensors , waveguides, and solar energy cells . Particularly, the strong oxidative power of photogenerated carriers on its surface has made TiO2 one of the most practical photocatalytic materials for purification and treatment of polluted water and air . 
 The calculations for absorption, total real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, as well as the optical band gap energy for the phase rutile were based on density function theory within the local density approximation (LDA), employing the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) method. We corrected the LDA band-gap energy self-consistently with an on-site Coulomb potential. The thin films for the measurements were prepared by DC magnetron sputtering and the transmission spectroscopy technique has been used to obtain the absorption spectrum. The theoretical result for the absorption compared qualitatively well with the experimental finding. The features of the dielectric functions are presented and the transition at the fundamental gap is discussed based on the electronic structure.. Situação: Em andamento; Natureza: Pesquisa.

Triad-Cluster Optical Transition
Descrição: In a lightly n-type doped semiconductor, low-temperature spectroscopic measurements exhibit a series of atomic like lines which correspond to the optical transitions of the isolated impurity atoms. As the impurity concentration increases donor-clusters rapidly become important. As the clusters get more dense the absorption edge drops since one can expect that the clusters with larger numbers of donors will absorb at low energies below the ionization and transition levels of the isolated impurities. The first attempts to explain such low energies were corried out  by Nagasaka and Narita. Bajaj et al. have observed a peak on the low energy side of the 1s to 2p transition, denominated as line ''X'', in their spectroscopic investigations of the donors in three different III-V and II-VI semiconductor systems.	
The investigation of the shallow donors in GaN-based wide band gap semiconductors has recently attracted much interest as an important issue in the fabrication of optoelectronic and electronic devices. Work to date has concentrated on the search for the optical transitions from these donor impurities. In recent Fourier transformed infrared measurements of n-type doped wurtzite GaN by Moore et al. an unidentified sharp absorption line on the low energy side of the 1s to 2p transition was obtained at a certain impurity concentration. However, an explanation to the origin of this line was not provided. Since the position of the line is rather stringent, it cannot be explained in terms of transitions between isolated impurities. With these investigations in mind, we have directed the  work to investigate the ``X'' line in n-type GaAs as well as the low energy peak in n-type hexagonal GaN. The electronic structure of the donor-clusters is likely to be strongly affected by electron correlation, and self-consistent field calculations is inadequate even to capture the qualitative characteristics of the absorption for relatively separated molecular configurations. We have. Situação: Concluído; Natureza: Pesquisa. Alunos envolvidos: Mestrado acadêmico: (1) .

Porous Diamond-Like-Carbon
Descrição: Diamond-like-carbon (DLC) films have many attractive properties which can deal to potential applications. Besides mechanical and tribological characteristics, electrical and optical properties can, also, deserve special attention. More specifically, surface porosity in different kinds of materials exhibit very interesting optical effect related to porous density and size, suggesting new applications. In this work, porous diamond-like-carbon (PDLC)  has been investigated with transmission and reflection spectroscopies. Atomic Force Microscopy  (AFM) measurements has revealed an intriguing similarity between PDLC and porous silicon. The PDLC thin films were obtained on (100) silicon substrate by DC magnetron sputtering and stored in atmosphere environment. From transmission and reflection data we have observed broad spectra distributions, spanning the wavelength interval 900-350nm , corresponding to phonon energies from 1.46 to 3.50 eV, and with one broad maximum located around 825nm (1.6eV). The results are discussed in terms of surface-band oxidized-like absorber, which can be inferred as the source for the absorption from nanoporous. Porous diamond-like-carbon  has been investigated by photoluminescence, absorption and spectroscopic ellipsometry. We present the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric functions for the latest and compare them to the calculation done for diamond by a full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the local density approximation. We found a low real dielectric function of  about 1.5  at 0.8 eV whereas bulk diamond has e1(0) a value of 5.5 .. Situação: Em andamento; Natureza: Pesquisa.

Transport Properties of  Doped semiconductors at Low Temperatures
Descrição: . We investigated  the resistivity of doped semiconductorsfor temperature ranging from 1.7 to 300 K, with variation of the impurity concentration from the insulating to the metallic range. The band conduction activation energy is obtained from the slope of the resistivity at low impurity concentration.The samples were prepared by ion implantation in Van der Pauw structures delineated in Semiconductors as Si:Bi,Si:P,Bi, GaAs:C. The resistivities obtained experimentally are compared with resistivity values calculated from a generalized Drude approach (GDA) at similar temperatures and dopant concentrations. The impurity critical concentration Nc for the metal-nonmetal (MNM) transition is estimated from these results and calculated using three different computational methods,.

Spin Polariztion-Spintronic
Descrição: It is  worthwhile to figure out  that electron spin-filter is a basic spintronic device. However, despeite the fast growing research, and many proposals, there is still no definite experimental realization of such semiconductor device yet. A spin-filter device using nonmagnetic triple barriers III-V semiconductor structures has been recently proposed .It is based on the effect of electron spin polarization by ressonant tunneling, due in turn to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling , where the Kane ¿k.p method has also been  used. As a result of such coupling, it has been recently demonstraited the formation of spin-dependent minibands in the case of asymmetric superlattice, with asymmetric double-barrier unit cells. We  investigate the spin-dependent current for such superlattices with  results for instance to InGaAs based asymmetric structures with different pairs of lattice-matched barriers materials (InP, InAlAs and GaAsSb)and extend the model to spin dependent properties of magnetic dilute semiconductors by means of electronic structure calculation.This method can also been used for MOSFET (metal oxide field effect transition) as well..
